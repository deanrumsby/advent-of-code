# Advent of Code Solutions

These are my solutions for the yearly Advent of Code puzzle series.

I started this repo with solutions in Python but I am slowly moving these to Elixir and using [Livebook](https://livebook.dev)
as I find being able to run my solutions interactively, whilst also adding markup is a very enjoyable experience.
